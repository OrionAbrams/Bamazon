# Bamazon
Pseudo Amazon terminal app using mysql. If you want to run this you must have a mysql localhost, and run a mysql query with the schema provided to populate the database with some data.

# Motivation

Needing to understand mysql code to be able to work with programming large databases essentially got me through this.

# Code Example
